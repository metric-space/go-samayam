##Go-Samayam

###About
 
This is a command line utility used to log events, create a to-do-list,
schedule appointments and time activities.


### Project Goals

1. clean go code ( not accomplished)
2. heavily commented ( haha ... yeah sure )
3. absolutely no-admin related stuff ( using termbox-go may be a violation of that goal )
4. Easy to install and use ( still working on that )
5. Target distros: Arch for now (  still far from that )
